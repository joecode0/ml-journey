# Introduction

I asked GPT-4 the following question:

Give me a series of 10 machine learning models/projects that I should build in Python, that progressively get harder, and will take me from someone who has done some basic machine learning to an expert in the field

Here was the response:

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a list of 10 machine learning projects that increase in difficulty. By completing all these projects, you should develop a strong foundation in machine learning and become an expert in the field.

1) **Linear Regression**: Predict house prices using a dataset with features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc. This will help you learn basic data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation using regression metrics.
2) **Logistic Regression**: Build a spam email classifier using a labeled dataset. This will introduce you to binary classification, text preprocessing, and evaluation using classification metrics.
3) **Decision Trees and Random Forests**: Use the famous Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. Learn about decision trees, random forests, feature importance, and hyperparameter tuning using grid search.
4) **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. Learn about SVMs, kernels, and multi-class classification.
5) **K-means Clustering**: Perform customer segmentation using a dataset with features like age, income, and spending habits. Learn about unsupervised learning, clustering algorithms, and silhouette scores.
6) **Recommender System**: Develop a content-based movie recommender system using the MovieLens dataset. Learn about similarity measures like cosine similarity, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization techniques.
7) **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Sentiment analysis on movie reviews or tweets using a pre-trained word embedding like Word2Vec or GloVe. Learn about text preprocessing, word embeddings, and basic neural networks.
8) **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Classify images using the CIFAR-10 dataset. Learn about CNNs, data augmentation, transfer learning, and model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrices.
9) **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and LSTM**: Predict stock prices using historical data. Learn about RNNs, LSTMs, sequence-to-sequence models, and time series analysis.
10) **Reinforcement Learning**: Build an agent to play a simple game like CartPole or Pong using OpenAI Gym. Learn about Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks (DQN), and policy gradient methods.

By working through these projects, you'll gain experience in various machine learning algorithms, techniques, and real-world applications. You will learn to preprocess data, evaluate model performance, and fine-tune your models. This journey will help you become an expert in the machine learning field.

So, let's do it. Note: They are fairly vague, so generally I will still be trying to create the best model I can but within a reasonable amount of time.
